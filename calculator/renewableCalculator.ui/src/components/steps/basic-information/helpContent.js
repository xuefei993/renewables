      "• Detached: Higher heat loss due to more external walls and roof area. More space for solar panels but higher heating needs.",

      "• Semi-detached: Moderate efficiency with one shared wall reducing heat loss. Good balance of efficiency and solar potential.",
      "",
      "• Terraced: Better efficiency with two shared walls reducing heat loss significantly. Limited roof space but lower energy needs.",

      "• End-terraced: Good efficiency with one shared wall. More external wall area than mid-terrace but better than detached.",

      "This affects heating costs, solar panel placement options, and heat pump sizing requirements for your property."

      "• Before 1930: Typically poor insulation, single glazing, solid walls. Higher energy consumption but often larger roof areas.",
      "",
      "• 1930-1980: Basic insulation standards, some double glazing introduced. Moderate efficiency with cavity walls becoming common.",
      "",
      "• 1981-2002: Improved building standards, better insulation requirements, double glazing standard.",
      "",
      "• After 2003: Modern building regulations with good thermal efficiency, proper insulation, and energy-efficient windows.",

      "Newer properties typically need smaller heating systems and achieve better renewable energy performance with faster payback periods."

      "• C-D Rating: Good to average efficiency. Moderate energy consumption, good renewable energy potential.",
      "",
      "• E-F Rating: Poor efficiency, higher energy consumption. Larger systems needed but greater potential savings.",

      "• G Rating: Very poor efficiency, very high energy use. Maximum benefit from efficiency improvements and renewables.",
      "",
      "Better ratings mean lower heating bills, smaller renewable systems needed, and faster payback on green technology investments."
